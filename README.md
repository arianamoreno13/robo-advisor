## Description
An AWS-built investment advisor bot is an artificial intelligence tool that provides personalized investment recommendations to users based on various data inputs, including their age, and risk tolerance. This bot leverages the power of machine learning algorithms and natural language processing techniques to analyze vast amounts of financial data and make informed investment decisions. The bot can interact with users through a user-friendly interface, such as a chatbot, and can be integrated into existing financial applications. This project uses AWS Lex and Lambda. The Lex Bot uses Lambda to check against constraints.

- Bot name: RoboAdvisor
- Language: English (US)
- Output voice: Salli
- Session timeout: 5 Minutes
- Sentiment analysis: No

    - I'm â€‹{age} and I want to invest for my retirement
    - I want the best option to invest for my retirement
    - I'm worried about my retirement

    - firstName (AMAZON.US_FIRST_NAME)
    - age (AMAZON.NUMBER)
    - investmentAmount (AMAZON.NUMBER)

Once everything has been defined, we can test our bot using Lex. As the picture shows below:
